### Density Based Traffic Light Controlling

# AIM
The aim of this project is to revolutionize traditional traffic signal management systems by introducing a dynamic and responsive approach to traffic control. By leveraging the capabilities of the ESP32 micro-
controller and ultrasonic sensors, the project seeks to develop a smart traffic management system that can adaptive adjust signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. The primary objective is to optimize traffic flow, minimize waiting times at intersections, and enhance overall urban mobility and efficiency.
