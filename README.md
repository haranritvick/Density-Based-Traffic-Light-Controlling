# Density Based Traffic Light Controlling

### AIM
The aim of this project is to revolutionize traditional traffic signal management systems by introducing a dynamic and responsive approach to traffic control. By leveraging the capabilities of the ESP32 micro-
controller and ultrasonic sensors, the project seeks to develop a smart traffic management system that can adaptive adjust signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. The primary objective is to optimize traffic flow, minimize waiting times at intersections, and enhance overall urban mobility and efficiency.

### APPARATUS/SOFTWARE REQUIRED
Hardware:
1) ESP32 WiFi Module (1): The ESP32 serves as the central processing unit for the traffic management
system, responsible for reading data from ultrasonic sensors and controlling traffic signals.
2) Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 (4): These sensors detect the presence of vehicles at each intersection
by measuring the distance to the nearest object.
3) Red, Yellow, and Green LED’s (4 each): These LED’s are used to indicate the status of traffic
signals at each intersection.
4) Connecting Wires: Wires are used to establish connections between components on the breadboard.
5) Micro-USB Cable: The USB cable is used to power the ESP32 module.
6) Breadboard: Provides a platform for assembling and connecting the hardware components.
Software:
1) Blynk Cloud Platform: The Blynk platform is utilized for real-time monitoring and control of the
traffic management system. It enables users to remotely monitor traffic conditions and adjust signal
timings as needed.
